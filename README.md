ingenious-gatsby is the GatsbyJS and GraphQL-powered frontend that powers ShortTech. The site is served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
On the backend site, ShortTech is powered by a headless [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) installation.

## Setup development environment
ingenious-gatsby is using `yarn` to manage its dependencies, as it is the recommended package.

````

Clone the GitHub repository with `git clone`.
```
git clone https://github.com/ShortTechDE/ingenious-gatsby.git
cd ingenious-gatsby
```

Install the dependencies with `yarn`.
